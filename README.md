# CSE 12 PA2: Generics & ArrayLists
This project implements a data structure that mimics Java's ArrayList, utilizing generic types for flexibility. The primary goal is to provide an efficient way to store and manipulate a dynamic array of objects. The project includes functionality for adding, removing, and accessing elements, along with methods for resizing the underlying array as needed. JUnit tests are integrated to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implementation, verifying that the ArrayList behaves as expected under various scenarios. The code is organized into starter files that facilitate the implementation process, providing a solid foundation for development.
